Thai and Cambodian forces have agreed to a temporary ceasefire after five days of intense clashes over a disputed border area near the Preah Vihear temple. The agreement, brokered by Malaysia, calls for ASEAN observers to monitor compliance on both sides.

According to Reuters, at least 50 combatants and 30 civilians have been killed since fighting erupted on Sept. 19. Both armies accuse each other of violating sacred sites and using heavy artillery. The foreign ministries of both nations affirmed their commitment to dialogue but warned that any breach would restart hostilities.

ASEAN Secretary-General Dato Lim Jock Hoi welcomed the accord but cautioned that enforcement mechanisms must be robust to prevent renewed fighting.

Local residents report more than 10,000 displaced persons in buffer zones as families flee to nearby provinces.

International observers remain cautious about the durability of the truce amidst nationalistic pressure in both countries.

Rockets fired from Cambodian positions hit Thai villages near the Preah Vihear temple, injuring at least ten civilians on Monday. Thailand responded with artillery salvos that damaged Cambodian border outposts.

The battle for strategic high ground has renewed tensions that simmered since a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 restored Cambodia’s sovereignty over the temple site.

Residents on both sides of the frontier have fled to makeshift camps as fears of a broader conflict mount.

Diplomats from ASEAN nations are convening in Kuala Lumpur to push for a ceasefire, while NGOs warn of looming humanitarian crises.

In an unprecedented move, the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia have invited ASEAN peacekeeping forces to monitor a fragile ceasefire along their disputed border. The agreement was reached during a summit in Kuala Lumpur mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

The conflict, which reignited on Sept. 19, centers on contested terrain surrounding the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Since hostilities began, both sides have reported dozens of fatalities, including among civilian populations.

Human Rights Watch has called for greater protection of displaced families, who currently number over 12,000. The United Nations has offered logistical support for ASEAN observers, though some members question the bloc’s capacity to enforce peace.

Analysts say the move marks a shift in regional dynamics, with ASEAN stepping into security roles traditionally reserved for the UN.

Heavy exchanges of artillery and small-arms fire between Thai and Cambodian forces continued for a third day on Tuesday, as both sides sought control of high ground overlooking the disputed area near the Preah Vihear temple.

At least 40 combatants and 25 civilians have been reported killed since clashes began on Friday. Witnesses describe scenes of horror as villages were caught in crossfire.

ASEAN officials are calling for an immediate halt to hostilities and have proposed sending observers, though both governments have yet to sign formal agreements.

International aid agencies are mobilizing relief convoys, but access remains limited by security concerns. The Thai military has deployed additional battalions to secure border routes, while Cambodia has fortified positions atop strategic ridges.

Political analysts warn that nationalist sentiment in both capitals could undermine diplomatic efforts, raising fears of a protracted conflict.
